What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a new staging area gets created



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a temporary step/buffer to hold changes before committing them.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Need to check what file/change by comparing it with commit 1 (most recent) is in the stage area before commiting

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
This is a helpful tool to keep several versions of the code so it is always easy to roll back.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It helps to see the relation of hirarchy of the commits

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
All the commits on both branches were saved in a new master branch.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
